## Templates

All of our template helpers can be called either as a block helper, like
`{{dstache}}#Surface}} ..content.. {{dstache}}/Surface}}` or with template inclusion,
like `{{dstache}}>Surface template="content"}}`.

* **{{dstache}}#famous}}**

  This is our main wrapper function, and may be called with `view="Scrollview"`, etc.
  Alternatively, a shortcut is created for every wrapped View and Modifier, so you
  can simply use `{{dstache}}#Scrollview}}`, etc, directly.  Please see the
  <a href="/views/README">Views README</a> for the full documentation.

* **{{dstache}}#famousEach items}}**

  Use this inside any view that has a `.sequenceFrom()` method (e.g. `Scrollview`,
  `SequentialLayout`, etc).  Just like regular `{{dstache}}each}}` - fully reactive,
  and preserves ordering.  `items` can be an array, a function that reactively
  returns an array, or a reactive cursor (from minimongo, etc).

* **{{dstache}}#famousIf reactiveBooleanHelper}}**

  Use this inside any view that has a `.sequenceFrom()` method (e.g. `Scrollview`,
  `SequentialLayout`, etc).  Just like regular `{{dstache}}if}}` - fully reactive,
  and preserves ordering.  `reactiveBooleanHelper` is a reactive helper that
  evaluates to `true` or `false`.

* **{{dstache}}#famousContext}}**

  Creates a new Famous Context (different to the `FView.mainCtx` automatically
  added to the document body).  Useful for embedded Contexts with different
  `perspective`s, or for putting Famo.us content inside of the regular DOM.
  Please realize that using the regular DOM model can have big impacts on
  performance!  You should only do this if you know what you're doing.  In
  particular, see the CSS section of
  [Famo.us Pitfalls](http://famo.us/guides/pitfalls).

  Additionally, the new context will be attached to the *containing div*, for
  absolute control over the context (this might change; keep an eye out on
  History.md for BREAKING changes, as usual).  In particular, make sure your
  CSS or `style` attribute ensures that the element's `height` is appropriate
  for what you have planned.  Example:

  ```handlebars
  <div style="height: 200px">
    {{dstache}}#famousContext}}
      ..
    {{dstache}}/famousContext}}
  </div>
  ```

## JavaScript

### FView global

* **FView.from(elementOrTemplateOrBlazeView)**

  Given a DOM element, a
  [Template Instance](https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/template_inst)
  (via Template lifecycle callbacks, events and helpers) or a
  [Blaze View](https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/blaze_view) (in more
  advanced applications), returns the relevant `MeteorFamousView`
  instance (more on that below).

  NB: For template instances, probably you only want to use it for
  inclusion, e.g. for `{{dstache}}#Surface template="mySurface"}}` and then
  `Template.mySurface.rendered = function() { var fview = FView.from(this); }`
  returns the `Surface`.
  If you call it on a regular Template, you'll get the View that contains
  that template, e.g. `{{dstache}}SequentialLayout}} {{dstache}}> myTemplate}} {{dstache}}/SequentialLayout}}` and then  `Template.myTemplate.rendered =
  function() { var fview = FView.from(this); }` returns the `SequentialLayout`.
  For more detailed info, see [issue #88](https://github.com/gadicc/meteor-famous-views/issues/88).

* **FView.byId(id)**

  Returns a MeteorFamousView instance given it's unique `id`.  To define your
  own, call your View with `{{dstache}}#Surface id="mySurface"}}` (on the
  assumption that the View will only ever appear once, simultaneously).  Otherwise,
  every instance gets it's own unique, sequential, numerical id; you can find it
  in the JavaScript console, and this is very useful for debugging.

### MeteorFamousView ("fview")

For every wrapped Famous view/modifier/node called like `{{dstache}}Surface}}`, etc,
a new `MeteorFamousView` instance is created.  This is actually a Famo.us
`RenderNode` and part of the Render Tree, which also tracks some extra info about
it's use.  When you call `FView.byId()` or `FView.from()`, this is the `fview`
that you get.

**Properties:**

* `id` - the instance's unique id, as above.  Use with `FView.byId(id)`.
* `blazeView` - the [Blaze.View](https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/blaze_view)
used to create this instance
* `node` - the Famo.us node passed back to Famo.us when rendering the tree
* `parent` - the `MeteorFamousView` of which this one is a child
* `children` - any children `MeteorFamousView` of this one


* `surface` - exists if the (final) node is a Surface, and points back to it
* `view` - exists if the node is a View, and points back to it.
* `_view` - registered metadata for the above view, if it exists
* `modifier` - a reference to any modifier automatically prepended to the node,
if it exists.  (e.g. if you specifed `modifier="StateModifier"`)
* `_modifier` - registered metadata for the above modifier, if it exists

Some even more advanced properties exist for special wrappers, like `famousEach`,
`famousIf`, etc, and for views which use `.sequenceFrom()` (i.e. the recursive
`sequencer()` method).  There is also a `pipeChildrenTo` property.  Search the
source for these properties if you want more info.

**Methods:**

* `preventDestroy(isTemplateDestroy)` - will keep the instance alive in the render
tree even
once the template/blazeView that created it is removed/destroyed.  You should
then, at a later, appropriate time, call `fview.destroy()` on the instance
for proper cleanup.  Useful for exit animations, render transitions, etc.

  If `isTemplateDestroy` is `true`, the `onDestroy()` callback is run (if it
  exists), and the `destroyPrevented` property is honored to stop the
  remaining cleanup.  Currently the `onDestroy` property can set as a single
  callback, but this might change to be a method to add multipel callbacks!
  For the rest of the cleanup, `Blaze.remove()` is called on all children
  blazeViews (which will trigger their destroys), we're removed from any
  sequence we may be a part of, and all Famo.us references are set to `null`
  to allow memory to be reclaimed by the garbage collector.

* `getSize()`, `render()` - used by Famo.us.  `setNode()` is used internally
and should not be called again unless you really know what you're doing.
