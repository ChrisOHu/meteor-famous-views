## Template Helpers

* **{{dstache}}#famous}}**

  This is our main wrapper function, and may be called with
  `view="Scrollview"`, etc.  Alternatively, a shortcut is created for every
  wrapped View and Modifier, so you can simply use `{{dstache}}#Scrollview}}`,
  etc, directly.  Every view can be called as either a **block helper**, like
  `{{dstache}}#Surface}} ..content.. {{dstache}}/Surface}}` or with **template
  inclusion**, like `{{dstache}}>Surface template="content"}}`.  Inclusion
  is necessary to set up life-cycle callbacks, like `rendered`, and
  [famousEvents](/examples/events), on the template.  Please see the
  <a href="/views/README">Views README</a> for the full documentation.

* **{{dstache}}#famousContext}}**

  Creates a new Famous Context.  If called with `id="mainCtx"`, a "main"
  context is created: famo.us runs in "appMode" and controls rendering for
  the entire viewport; appropriate CSS classes are added to `html` and `body`.
  Additionally, plugins depend on this name.

  If called with any other `id`, or without one, the context is created in
  an isolated div.  You can use this in a "regular" web page where you only
  want famo.us to run in parts of it.  You can also embed a famousContext
  inside a `Surface`, which is particularly useful for setting different
  `perspective`'s'.

  The optional arguments `id`, `class` and `style` are all used to create
  the container div.

* **{{dstache}}#famousIf reactiveBooleanHelper}}**

  Use this between Famo.us nodes (as opposed to inside of Surfaces).  Just like
  regular `{{dstache}}if}}` - fully reactive, preserves ordering, and cleans
  up children when the condition changes.  `reactiveBooleanHelper` is a
  reactive helper that evaluates to `true` or `false`.

* **{{dstache}}#famousEach items}}**

  Use this inside any view that has a `.sequenceFrom()` method (e.g. `Scrollview`,
  `SequentialLayout`, etc).  Just like regular `{{dstache}}each}}` - fully reactive,
  and preserves ordering.  `items` can be an array, a function that reactively
  returns an array, or a reactive cursor (from minimongo, etc).  See **Events**
  below for how to extend or override the default observe events (`addedAt`,
  `removedAt`, `changedAt`, `movedTo`).

## JavaScript

### FView global

* **FView.from(elementOrTemplateOrBlazeView)**

  Given a DOM element, a
  [Template Instance](https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/template_inst)
  (via Template lifecycle callbacks, events and helpers) or a
  [Blaze View](https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/blaze_view) (in more
  advanced applications), returns the relevant `MeteorFamousView`
  instance (more on that below).

  NB: For template instances, probably you only want to use it for
  inclusion, e.g. for `{{dstache}}#Surface template="mySurface"}}` and then
  `Template.mySurface.rendered = function() { var fview = FView.from(this); }`
  returns the `Surface`.
  If you call it on a regular Template, you'll get the View that contains
  that template, e.g. `{{dstache}}SequentialLayout}} {{dstache}}> myTemplate}} {{dstache}}/SequentialLayout}}` and then  `Template.myTemplate.rendered =
  function() { var fview = FView.from(this); }` returns the `SequentialLayout`.
  For more detailed info, see [issue #88](https://github.com/gadicc/meteor-famous-views/issues/88).

* **FView.byId(id)**

  Returns a MeteorFamousView instance given it's unique `id`.  To define your
  own, call your View with `{{dstache}}#Surface id="mySurface"}}` (on the
  assumption that the View will only ever appear once, simultaneously).  Otherwise,
  every instance gets it's own unique, sequential, numerical id; you can find it
  in the JavaScript console, and this is very useful for debugging.

### MeteorFamousView ("fview")

For every wrapped Famous view/modifier/node called like `{{dstache}}Surface}}`, etc,
a new `MeteorFamousView` instance is created.  This is actually a Famo.us
`RenderNode` and part of the Render Tree, which also tracks some extra info about
it's use.  When you call `FView.byId()` or `FView.from()`, this is the `fview`
that you get.

**Properties:**

* `id` - the instance's unique id, as above.  Use with `FView.byId(id)`.
* `blazeView` - the [Blaze.View](https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/blaze_view)
used to create this instance
* `node` - the Famo.us node passed back to Famo.us when rendering the tree
* `parent` - the `MeteorFamousView` of which this one is a child
* `children` - any children `MeteorFamousView` of this one


* `surface` - exists if the (final) node is a Surface, and points back to it
* `view` - exists if the node is a View, and points back to it.
* `_view` - registered metadata for the above view, if it exists
* `modifier` - a reference to any modifier automatically prepended to the node,
if it exists.  (e.g. if you specifed `modifier="StateModifier"`)
* `_modifier` - registered metadata for the above modifier, if it exists

Some even more advanced properties exist for special wrappers, like `famousEach`,
`famousIf`, etc, and for views which use `.sequenceFrom()` (i.e. the recursive
`sequencer()` method).  There is also a `pipeChildrenTo` property.  Search the
source for these properties if you want more info.

**Methods:**

* `preventDestroy()` - will keep the instance alive in the render tree even
  once the template/blazeView that created it is removed/destroyed.  You should
  then, at a later, appropriate time, call `fview.destroy()` on the instance
  for proper cleanup.  Useful for exit animations, render transitions, etc.

* `destroy(isTemplateDestroy)` -
  If `isTemplateDestroy` is `true`, the `destroy` event is fired,
  and the `destroyPrevented` property is honored to stop the
  remaining cleanup.  Otherwise, `Blaze.remove()` is called on all children
  blazeViews (which will trigger their destroys), we're removed from any
  sequence or parent we belong to, and all Famo.us references are set to `null`
  to allow memory to be reclaimed by the garbage collector.  Finally, the
  `cleanup` event is fired for anything extra that might be needed.

* `getSize()`, `render()` - used by Famo.us.  `setNode()` is used internally
  and should not be called again unless you really know what you're doing.

**Events:**

Usage: `fview.on("event", callback)` - similar to node EventEmitter API.
listeners(event), removeListener(event, callback) exist too.

* `destroy` - fires when fview.destoy() is called *by Blaze*, see above.
* `cleanup` - fires during a complete destroy(), to nullify references, etc.

## Events

### famousEach

  The *containing view* may register functions that extend the default *observe*
  events handled.  `addedAt`, `changedAt`, `removedAt` and `movedTo` fire at
  the same times and with the same arguments as a regular Meteor observe, in
  addition to two more arguments, `_super()` and `eachView`.  Additionally,
  `this` will be the View's `fview`.  Example:

    {{/markdown}}

    <p style="margin-left: 40px">

      {{#snippet lang="spacebars"}}
        {{dstache}}#CustomView}}
          {{dstache}}#famousEach items}}
            {{dstache}}#Surface size="[undefined,true]"}}
              {{dstache}}name}}
            {{dstache}}/Surface}}
          {{dstache}}/famousEach}}
        {{dstache}}/CustomView}}
      {{else}}
        {{#if currentLang "jade"}}
          +CustomView
            +famousEach items
              +Surface size="[undefined,true]"
                #{name}
        {{/if}}
      {{/snippet}}

      {{#snippet lang="javascript"}}
        FView.registerView('CustomView', famous.views.SequentialLayout, {
          addedAt: function(id, item, index, _super, eachView) {
            // Extend the default functionality
            _super();
            this.view.update();
          },
          movedTo: function(id, doc, fromIndex, toIndex, _super, eachView) {
            // Override the default functionality (don't call `_swap()`)
            this.view.swap(fromIndex, toIndex);
          },
          movedTo: function(id, doc, fromIndex, toIndex, _super, eachView) {
            // Override/adapt the default functionality
            var fview = eachView.fview;  // see lib/famousEach.js

            var item = fview.sequence.splice(fromIndex, 1)[0];
            fview.sequence.splice(toIndex, 0, item);
            item = fview.children.splice(fromIndex, 1)[0];
            fview.children.splice(toIndex, 0, item);
          }
        });
      {{else}}
        {{#if currentLang "coffee"}}
        {{/if}}
      {{/snippet}}

    </p>

    {{#markdown}}

  instead of registering a new view, you can also simply added these
  functions to View instance's `fview`, e.g:

    {{/markdown}}
    {{#snippet lang="javascript"}}
      Template.myView.rendered = function() {
        var fview = FView.from(this);
        fview.addedAt = function() {
          _super();
        };
      }
    {{/snippet}}
    {{#markdown}}

## ChangeLog

### v0.1.32

* * fview.on(event, callback) like node, supporting: "destroy", "cleanup"

### v0.1.31

* Allow the *containing View* to override/extend famousEach's observe
events (addedAt, removedAt, movedTo, updatedAt).
