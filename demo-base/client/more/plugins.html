    	<h1>FView Plugins</h1>

      <p>Famous-views makes it very easy to wrap famo.us components to work great
      with Meteor.  We encourage anyone to publish "plugins" that 1) wrap
      community components, 2) works great with both raix:famono and mjn:famous,
      and 3) tweaks as necessary to introduce reactivity, play nice, etc.  For more
      info on building plugins, for now, see
      <a href="https://github.com/gadicc/meteor-famous-views/issues/136">issue
      #136</a>.  Want your plugin to show up here?  Add it to this list with a
      pull request.</p>

        Adaptive Images!  Need your images to fit how you want them?
        This is
        [@IjzerenHein's
        BkSurfaceImage](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/famous-bkimagesurface)
        packaged for famous-views: BkImageSurface adds support for
        sizing strategies such as **AspectFit** and **AspectFill** for displaying
        images with famo.us. It uses a `div` with a background-image rather than
        a `img` tag.  Can be used as a drop-in replacement for ImageSurface, in case the size of the div is not derived from the image.

        A developer must!  Want a live FPS count and chart showing computation
        times?  This is
        [@IjzerenHein's
        Lagometer](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/famous-lagometer)
        packaged for famous-views.  Since the meter itself uses quite a lot
        of CPU, it's disabled by default, but available whenever you need it
        by pressing ALT-L (for lag).  This `debugOnly` package is never
        bundled/deployed.
