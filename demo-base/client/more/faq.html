            It would be great but very inefficient for us to emulate Meteor's
            behaviour exactly.  Note that as per the
            <a href="http://famo.us/guides/pitfalls">Famo.us Pitfalls</a>
            guide, pinging the DOM <i>is really bad practice</i> and can cause
            performance problems in your app.  Two easy workarounds:

            <ol>
              <li><b>Use <code>this.$()</code> instead</b> - since although your
              template is not in the DOM yet, it is part of the DOM range in
              your template instance.  <i>This is much faster too</i>.</li>

              <li><b>Wrap your code in
              <code>window.requestAnimationFrame()</code></b>,
              if you need your DIV to be "fully rendered", i.e., not just on the
              DOM, but updated by Famous too.  This is because Famo.us buffers
              changes for performance, and this way you'll ensure your code runs
              after the commit.  <i>Avoid if possible.</i></li>
